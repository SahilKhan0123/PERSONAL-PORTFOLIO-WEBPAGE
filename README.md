"DESCRIPTION" : This is a fully responsive and modern personal portfolio website built using HTML and CSS. It highlights my skills, projects, and contact details in a clean, structured layout. The site begins with a sticky navigation bar and a welcoming hero section that introduces me and directs users to my featured work.

The design uses a calming blue and white color scheme with smooth gradients and readable typography. Sections like "About Me", "Skills", and "Projects" are clearly organized, allowing visitors to easily understand who I am, what I know, and what Iâ€™ve created. The Projects section showcases key work like the Interactive Quiz App and Real-Time Chat App with images and descriptions.

Animations, hover effects, and responsive design principles are used to ensure the website looks great across all devices. I implemented smooth scrolling and intuitive navigation to enhance user experience. This project not only showcases my frontend skills but also reflects my personality and passion for technology.
